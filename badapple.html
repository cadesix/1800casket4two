"when i wrote ‘<a href="https://soundcloud.com/michaelxcasper/bad-apple/s-w2tNz">bad apple</a>’ a year ago i was at this place with my mental health
where i was letting my mania take over everything in my life.
almost every thought i had was a negative one and i was making my way into a world
where the colors around me weren’t as vibrant anymore. i was anxious about being
anxious which of course did nothing but make me more anxious.
i would take my anti-psychotics on and off depending on if i was in the mood to
feel suicidal or not. your perception starts to get all fucked up at a certain point.
reality begins to blend with the stories you’ve created in your head.
i just didn’t feel like i was enough, except when i was with u."<br>
